### Self-Introduction
Hi, my name is Mikhail Khilman. I am 31 years old and I am a Junior Frontend developer. I live and work in Minsk and now I am studying at RS School, here I am improving my skills in web development.

### My education
I graduated from the Minsk State College of Automotive Engineering.
My specialty was not related to information technology, so I learn everything in courses like this and on my own.

### My studies
At one point I decided I wanted to try my hand at a new field.
Now I learn every day, learn something new and use it in my work.
I love building websites, games and web applications.
I create beautiful, adaptive and user-friendly websites that meet the needs and expectations of users.
During development, I use modern technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Git, jQuery, Bootstrap and others.
I know accessibility, analytics, support for legacy browsers, API work, and do code optimization.
I am good at testing and debugging websites, looking for bugs in them. I also have a good understanding of other peopleâ€™s code.
Studying often challenges me and I constantly reach new heights.

### Main idea
I believe that programming is an art that requires not only knowledge, but also imagination, creativity and attention to detail.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
