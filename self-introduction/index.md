[Self-Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KHA8nMLjIU)


Hi, my name is Mikhail Khilman. I am 31 years old and I am a Junior Frontend developer. I live and work in Minsk and now I am studying at RS School, here I am improving my skills in web development.

I graduated from the Minsk State College of Automotive Engineering.

My specialty was not related to information technology, so I learn everything in courses like this and on my own.

At one point I decided I wanted to try my hand at a new field.

Now I learn every day, learn something new and use it in my work.

I love building websites, games and web applications.

I create beautiful, adaptive and user-friendly websites that meet the needs and expectations of users.

During development, I use modern technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Git, jQuery, Bootstrap and others.

I know accessibility, analytics, support for legacy browsers, API work, and do code optimization.

I am good at testing and debugging websites, looking for bugs in them. I also have a good understanding of other people's code.

Studying often challenges me and I constantly reach new heights.

I believe that programming is an art that requires not only knowledge, but also imagination, creativity and attention to detail.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
