# 🌟 My TypeScript Journey: Earned Badges 🌟

## 📋 Badges Overview

## 🚀 Reflections 

Learning TypeScript started with the basics. Learned syntax and data types. Determining variable types allowed us to avoid many errors at the compilation stage. During my training, I practiced creating interfaces and classes. Using generics, I created flexible and reusable components. I tried in practice creating modules and namespaces for functions. I liked training in Microsoft learn because of the structure and large number of examples.
